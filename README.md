Paragraph Describing What I Have Done And Learned:

Using the useState() hook has been interesting. As someone more familiar with Java/Python it still isn't very clear why this particular coding convention is needed when we could just use a global variable to the program and update it using a global setter function. But I imagine it has to do with JavaScript not really being an OOP language and operating under another language paradigm. I appreciate the simplicity of this lab just sticking to one component in order to emphasize the actual concept being learned in terms of the useState(). However I am left with the feeling that the concept could have been expanded on a bit more as towards why the hook or useState() needs to even be used in the first place.
